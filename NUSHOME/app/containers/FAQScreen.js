It looks into their welfare, oversees student-led initiatives and interest groups and works with the Master, Fellows and staff to build a vibrant and cohesive community. The CSC also represents the College to other student organisations in NUS.\n\nThe structure of the CSC can be categorised into 3 main committees: the Standing Committee, the Internal Committee, and the External Committee.\n\nStanding Committee\n\nThe Standing Committee consists of the President, External Vice President (EVP), Internal Vice President (IVP), General Secretary & Finance Secretary. They oversee the various groups in CAPT and serve as the link between the Internal & External Directors, Resident Fellows, Resident Assistants and Neighbourhood Heads.\n\nInternal Committee\n\nThe Internal Committee plans and executes initiatives, activities or events to engage with CAPTains within the college, striving to create a vibrant and dynamic college community. The committee helmed by the IVP, includes the Director of Sports, Director of Clubs and Societies, Director of Student Affairs, Director of Publicity, and their respective committees.\n\nSports Committee\nSports Comm oversees the sports scene here in CAPT. We have two main roles in CAPT – one is to maintain the existing Sports Interest Groups like Basketball, Tchoukball, Soccer and etc. while also facilitating and guiding any CAPTains that would like to start a new Sports Interest Group. The second role is to plan for both the intra and inter college sporting events such as Inter Neighbourhood Games and Inter College Games.\n\nThrough these roles, Sports Committee aims to unite CAPT through sports by providing a common platform for different neighbourhoods to come together for Inter neighbourhood friendships to be forged. Sports Committee also aims to use sports as an avenue for CE and health advocacy through our annual events like CE Sports Week and Health Awareness Week respectively.\n\nClubs and Societies (Clubsocs) Committee\nClubsocs promotes the arts and culture scene in CAPT, as well as various interests of CAPTains such as gardening, baking and coffee! There are three main areas of focus: the Clubsocs IGs that span a wide range of interests, events such as Arts Showcase and the management of Theme Rooms 1 and 2.\n\nClubsocs members join IGs regularly to understand what’s happening on the ground (and have fun of course!), set up for college events and help plan for Clubsocs CE and Arts Showcase. For the Theme Rooms, Clubsocs manages the booking of the rooms and ensures their cleanliness by conducting periodic spot checks to catch errant users, as well as having regular cleaning and purging.\n\nStudent Affairs Committee (SAC)\nThe Student Affairs Committee (SAC) manages and enhances the college welfare within CAPT. This is done via various events such as Inter-College Halloween, Welcome-Back Dinner, Inter-Neighbourhood Shield and CAPT Buddy. SAC is also in charge of the Flying Seed, CAPT Card and the End of Semester Welfare Packs. SAC enables the coverage of both tangible and intangible ways of enhancing the welfare of CAPTains through the means as described above.\n\nPublicity (Pubs) Committee\nPubs is in charge of the image of CAPT, both internally and externally. We aim to accurately capture and portray the CAPT spirit and culture, and create a warm, friendly, and inclusive environment for CAPTains. It is through this environment that we strive to create and sustain an feeling of homeliness for all CAPTains who step into CAPT.\n\nPubs takes care of the decor and content in the lifts and the level 1 lobby, and also sets up decorations for large scale college events as well. We are also in charge of all publicity and information dissemination platforms, which include the CAPTlife website, the @captnus Instagram account, the official CAPT Facebook page, and the CAPT in the Loop Telegram broadcast channel. We also manage the CAPT yearbook (CAPTsule), and all official CAPT merchandise.\n\nPubs is also in charge of media coverage for college events. We work very closely with CAPTure to ensure that coverage runs smoothly, and photos and videos are properly processed before dissemination.\n\nExternal Committee\n\nThe External Committee is led by the EVP, and consists of the Director of Active Community Engagement (ACE), Director of Social Innovation (SI), Director of External Affairs (EXA), and their respective committees. They function to coordinate and manage ties and relations between CAPT and our external stakeholders/partners. They also facilitate opportunities for CAPTains to engage with such partners.\n\nActive Community Engagement (ACE) Wing\nThe Active Community Engagement (ACE) Wing of CAPT supports CAPT’s ethos of active citizenship and community engagement by providing opportunities and platforms for CAPTains to engage with the community around them. Under ACE Wing, students take the lead in planning meaningful CE events with communities such as elderly, youth, migrants and even animal welfare groups for their peers. Through such engagements, we hope to build more empathetic, compassionate and active citizens who make a positive impact on society.\n\nSocial Innovation (SI) Wing\nHere at the SI Wing, we seek to discuss and address real social issues through innovative yet feasible means. Using Community Engagement as a medium to understand communities, we then work towards uncovering unmet needs and act on them. From empathising with the disadvantaged groups, to coming up with novel solutions and then implementing them, we are guided by the Design Thinking framework, specifically adapted to suit our unique objectives.\n\nThis year, the SI Wing has for the first time, partnered with external organisations to co-create projects for CAPTains to work on, realising our vision of applying Design Thinking to solve real social problems and creating a positive impact to the world we live in. If you are passionate about the community and have burning ideas to make a difference, the SI Wing welcomes you.\n\nFind out more about us on our blog at www.captsocialinnovation.com!\n\nExternal Affairs (EXA) Committee\nThe External Affairs (EXA) Committee aims to build sustainable relationships as well as forge friendships with external parties, mainly with our two main areas of focus: Outreach (other residential colleges) and Alumni. EXA acts as the main liaison between CAPT and other colleges as well as CAPT alumni.\n\nIn addition, EXA is in charge of planning events which provide opportunities as well as a platform for current CAPTains to interact with students from other residential colleges and our CAPT alumni. EXA has organised events like the Alumni Brunch, Graduand’s Party, and CAPTure the Fl4g. Furthermore, EXA also ensures that the CAPT Alumni is regularly updated on the current CAPT events through various platforms."
